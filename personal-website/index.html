        <p>The Porsche 918 Spyder is a sports car manufactured by German marque Porsche. The 918 Spyder is a plug-in hybrid powered by a mid-mounted naturally aspirated 4.6 L (4,593 cc) V8 engine, developing 447 kW (608 PS; 599 hp) at 8,700 RPM, with two electric motors delivering an additional 210 kW (286 PS; 282 hp) for a combined output of 652 kW (875 hp) and 1,280 N⋅m (944 lbf⋅ft) of torque. The 918 Spyder's 6.8 kWh lithium-ion battery pack delivers an all-electric range of 19 km (12 mi) under the US Environmental Protection Agency's five-cycle tests.[2]

        <p>With it being the best of 'The Holy Trinity' of hypercars and suprisingly the cheapest of the trinity. In october 2020, Top Gear labeled the Spyder a 'hybrid masterpiece' and 'the most complete car in the Holy Trinity'.This car is set with a battery twice the size of the McLaren P1. Although it only has a short range if you’re going totally electric and not running on the normal engine, it’s still considered the “most electric” of all three vehicles.

            As it was designed, the regular engine in the Spyder allows the car to get the most power upon acceleration and is then shut off to let the battery power do some of the work. Functioning this way, the Spyder can accelerate from zero to sixty miles per hour in a matter of 2.6 seconds. Only using electric capabilities, it can hit 62 mph in about six</p>
